I want it to make this plugin GPLed, but due to the license of the Monkey's Audio Codec,
I can't. So the source is available, everyone can only use it personally and in education.

And now, I make it GPLed, and will change it whenever the original author Matt asks.

Waiting for the change of the license of MAC.
